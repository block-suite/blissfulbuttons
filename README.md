# Blissful Buttons

Boring buttons don't get clicked. 

Buttons are made to be clicked. When you are using a boring button you are basically telling your users that you could care less if they click on it. What you need is a button style that is begging to be clicked. One where the user has no choice but to click it. That's why we created Blissful Buttons.
